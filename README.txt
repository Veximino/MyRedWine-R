-Utilized regression techniques on a data set containing various 
samples of red wine from Portuguese and building linear regression model.



Research questions and answer
1. How can we utilize a linear model to help find out what factors contribute 
to a good quality red wine so that we don't have to rely on people's review on wine quality?
-We can utilize linear regression and its models to help us identify the key factors that 
contribute to determining the quality of red wine. This will give us a more stable and 
efficient way to rate the quality of Red Wines rather than relying on another person's review.

2. Will the elimination of insignificant variable affect our results? 
-Based on the ANOVA testing, we can conclude the variables, volatile acidity, chlorides, 
free Sulphur dioxide, total Sulphur dioxide, pH, sulphates, and alcohol will not be eliminated.

3. What coefficients can be deemed insignificant and eliminated based on their value?
-As a result of the coefficients testing, the variables as density, fixed acidity, residual sugar,
and citric acid were deemed insignificant based on their high p value.
